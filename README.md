 ## Key Insights
 - Managers have an average monthly income of **₦17,182**, followed by Research Director
with an average monthly income of **₦16,032**. Health Care Representative, Manufacturing
Director, Sales Executive and others earning an average salary below **₦8,000** monthly.
- **Research & Development** has the most employees with **961**, then Sales with 446
employees, **Human Resources** has the least with **63** employees.
- The Average Distance from Home of Employees who left the Company is **10.63**.
- Most employees in lower job levels report moderate work-life balance, with **levels 2
and 3** being the most common. **Higher job levels** have fewer employees, and their work-
life balance ratings are more evenly distributed. This suggests that work-life balance slightly improves with seniority but remains a
concern across levels.
